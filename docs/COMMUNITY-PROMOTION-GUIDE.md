## Must-See Features (Top 10)

### 1. Interactive Globe with 35+ Data Layers

The centerpiece. A WebGL-accelerated globe (deck.gl) with toggleable layers for conflicts, military bases, nuclear facilities, undersea cables, pipelines, satellite fires, protests, cyber threats, and more. Zoom in and the detail layers progressively reveal.

**Show**: Toggle different layers on/off. Zoom into a conflict region. Show the layer panel.

### 2. AI-Powered World Brief

One-click AI summary of the top global developments. Three-tier LLM provider chain: local Ollama/LM Studio (fully private, offline), Groq (fast cloud), or OpenRouter (fallback). Redis caching for instant responses on repeat queries.

**Show**: The summary card at the top of the news panel.

### 3. Country Intelligence Dossiers

Click any country on the map for a full-page intelligence brief: instability score ring, AI-generated analysis, top headlines, prediction markets, 7-day event timeline, active signal chips, infrastructure exposure, and stock market data.

**Show**: Click a country (e.g., Japan, Ukraine, or Iran) → full dossier page.

### 4. 14 Languages Support 

Full UI in 14 languages including Japanese. Regional news feeds auto-adapt — Japanese users see NHK World, Nikkei Asia, and Japan-relevant sources. Language bundles are lazy-loaded for fast performance.

**Show**: Switch language to Japanese in the settings. Note how feeds change.

### 5. Live Military Tracking

Real-time ADS-B military flight tracking and AIS naval vessel monitoring. Strategic Posture panel shows theater-level risk assessment across 9 global regions (Baltic, Black Sea, South China Sea, Eastern Mediterranean, etc.).

**Show**: Enable the Military layer. Show the Strategic Posture panel.

### 6. Three Variant Dashboards

One codebase, three specialized views — switch between World (geopolitics), Tech (startups/AI), and Finance (markets/exchanges) with one click in the header bar.

**Show**: Click the variant switcher (🌍 WORLD | 💻 TECH | 📈 FINANCE).

### 7. Market & Crypto Intelligence

7-signal macro radar with composite BUY/CASH verdict, BTC spot ETF flow tracker, stablecoin peg monitor, Fear & Greed Index, and Bitcoin technical indicators. Sparkline charts and donut gauges for visual trends.

**Show**: Scroll to the crypto/market panels. Point out the sparklines.

### 8. Live Video & Webcam Feeds

8 live news streams (Bloomberg, Al Jazeera, Sky News, etc.) + 19 live webcams from geopolitical hotspots across 4 regions. Idle-aware — auto-pauses after 5 minutes of inactivity.

**Show**: Open the video panel or webcam panel.

### 9. Desktop Application (Free)

Native app for macOS, Windows, and Linux via Tauri. API keys stored in OS keychain (not plaintext). Local Node.js sidecar runs all 60+ API handlers offline-capable. Run local LLMs for fully private, offline AI summaries.

**Show**: The download buttons on the site, or the desktop app running natively.

### 10. Story Sharing & Social Export

Generate intelligence briefs for any country and share to Twitter/X, LinkedIn, WhatsApp, Telegram, Reddit. Includes canvas-rendered PNG images with QR codes linking back to the live dashboard.

**Show**: Generate a story for a country → share dialog with platform options.

### 11. Local LLM Support (Ollama / LM Studio)

Run AI summarization entirely on your own hardware — no API keys, no cloud, no data leaving your machine. The desktop app auto-discovers models from Ollama or LM Studio, with a three-tier fallback chain: local → Groq → OpenRouter. Settings are split into dedicated LLMs and API Keys tabs for easy configuration.

**Show**: Open Settings → LLMs tab → Ollama model dropdown auto-populated → generate a summary with the local model.
